    <h1> CAPTCHA - Findings of the Research Questions Task force</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>This documents summarizes findings of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/research-questions/">Research Questions Task Force</a> that are intended to inform revision of the W3C Working Group note: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA: Alternatives to Visual Turing Tests on the Web</a>. All references in this document to sections apply to the 23 November 2005 Working Group Note.
    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <p>[Discuss auditory as well as visual CAPTCHA, as they are more common now than they were in 2005. Note relevant research findings regarding the difficulty of using auditory CAPTCHA and improvements that can be made to the UI to address some of the concerns. Note investigation of the challenges posed by CAPTCHA to users with learning/cognitive disabilities, and internationalization concerns resulting from reliance on the Roman alphabet in character recognition challenges. perhaps a brief statement should be given here, with a cross-reference to more detailed discussion in section 3.2.]
    <h2>Section 1.1</h2>
    <p>[Note the literature regarding limitations of the effectiveness of CAPTCHA as a security mechanism.]
    <h2>Section 3.2</h2>
    <p>[This is where we should enter into a more detailed treatment of the limitations of auditory CAPTCHA, as demonstrated by research, even if we note its relevance to section 1. Perhaps passchords should be mentioned here, though they're more of an authentication technique than a CAPTCHA alternative.]
    <h2>Section 3.4.1</h2>
    <p>[Continuous authentication and risk analysis engines could be mentioned here.]
    <h2>Section 3.5 (entire section)</h2>
    <p>[Suggest updating discussion of federated identity, but we don't have research on this point. Add discussion of biometrics accessibility and E.U./U.S. government requirements to section 3.5.3. Explain the growing popularity of dual-factor authentication and how it might assist with the CAPTCHA problem (is it an instance of federated identity in this context - that is, when accessing a new Web site for the first time?).]</p>
